# About my code
I write most code in C# (and some C/C++), as well as some python. I write quite quickly, and therefore the readability may not be very good - though who's going to look at my code other than me... anyway if there arenâ€™t comments or docs, I wish you luck.
I will occasionally use OpenAI Codex or GitHub Copilot in my projects - but donâ€™t mistake this for vibe coding! I use AI tools mostly for documenting code, adding code comments, or creating git commit messages. Essentially all the code is written by me though!

# About my repos
Most of my early repos are console projects - the most significant ones are my 3D renderer (experimental), and The Stranger Quest (unfinished). Almost all repos since those early days are significantly more advanced, for example Sunny-Sanbot, which is in development as I'm writing this in September '25.
You will likely find some repos that are improperly documented or just unfinished. Most of these will have been early repos of mine before I started using GitHub properly. You can ignore those - all later work should be properly maintained.
