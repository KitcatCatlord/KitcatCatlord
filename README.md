**About my projects**

I do most work in C# (and other C langauges), and most of my early projects are console projects - the most significant ones are my 3D renderer (experimental), and The Stranger Quest (unfinished). Most of my projects after those are going to be more advanced, for example Sunny-Sanbot, which is in development as I'm writing this in September '25. The Sunny-Sanbot project is the largest project I've evet worked on - itâ€™s a multilingual AI driven hardware control for a humanoid robot I own with no documentation. I intend to document my development in YouTube videos, which I will link in the repo. Most of my projects are done solo, sometimes with a little but of help with a friend of mine SmashedFrenzy16.

A few of my early projects may seem unfinished or with no real purpose. This is because I used to use Visual Studio for programming, and I didnâ€™t use github integration with that. Now I use Visual Studio Code, I have proper git integration so my newer projects should update to completion and be managed better. I donâ€™t have many private repos, but I will slowly unprivate any as they near a state which they can be published.

I will also occasionally use OpenAI Codex in my projects - I usually use it for mundane tasks, or to implement small features when Iâ€™m away and I believe itâ€™s not a big deal. Some people may be agaist this, but in my opinion, Codex is an incredibly useful and powerful tool, and although it is 'vibe-coding' to an extent, I believe for smaller or more mundane tasks, it is a good way to reduce workload (especially as a mostly solo developer) and provide myself more time to work on more important features.
