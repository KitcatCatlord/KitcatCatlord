# About me

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KitcatCatlord
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m primarily a musician, but I do a lot of programming and CAD
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (straight)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees


# About my code

My languages are:
- C# main
- C, C++ secondary
- Python ternary

Good to know:
- I use AI tools like Copilot or Codex to annotate and document code
- I am not a vibe coder! Most of my program content is written by me
- I also use AT to generate commit messages because keeping track of everything whilst using imperative is (usually) a waste of time

# About my repos

Early repos:
- Console projects (.NET FW)
- Usually simple and/or incomplete
- Donâ€™t use Git properly
- Sometimes disfunctional

Modern repos:
- Use various frameworks
- Use Git properly
- Functional (if not indev of course)

Other notes:
- I will frequently publish tools and such that I write for myself. These may be very simple, but every commit counts towards the Git Graph ;)
- Lots of smaller repos wonâ€™t have releases, so you'll have to build them yourselves if you want to use them
